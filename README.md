# NN_Scratch_Implementation

## This repository contains an implementation of a neural network from scratch. Forward and back propogation is manually calculated while using the sigmoid activation function.
## It was used for educational purposes and reinforcing concepts commonly used in neural networks. As such the model performs terribly and is not fine tuned.
